Design Decisions
- I added a field to store the board in Game. I had some trouble to use
python list so I used PickleProperty because it allowed
me to store a Python List in the datastore which seemed like the simplest way
to record the state of the board.
- I also added next_move, user_x, user_o, and winner (all KeyProperty) to the Game
model to keep track of which User was either 'X' or 'O' and who's move it was.
- I also board_size though it was not necessary but it will give flexibility to extend
complexity by increasing this board size
- I used a 'game_over' flag as well to mark completed games.
-  Score model modified to record result of the game.
It contains 4 fields (user_x, user_o, result and date). Result field can contains
3 types result. I stored string instead of string make it more easy. these values can
be: 'user_x', 'user_o' and 'tie'.

- I game 2 points to winner and 2 points for tie and 0 points for lose
- I used win_percentage and no_lose_percentage to calculate user rank
- I decided to give players 2 points for win, 1 point for tie and 0 points for lose.
