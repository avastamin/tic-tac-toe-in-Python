Design Decisions
- I was getting trouble to design the board in datastore. I was also in trouble
  about field type, storing every move, differentiate moves(position taken) based on user.
  Firtly, I tried to create 2 different field for every user to store their moves
  but it was not so perfect to make decesion about result of the game. First I choosen list
  as board but again it was not perfect choice then user PickleProperty which is easy to list
  and update over time.
- There was another problem to track which user already placed his moves. I wanted to store this
on session or cokkie but game can be postponed a long time and resume again so it was not also so perfect
Then I choose another field called next_move which will store the value of the user whose turn next to move.

- I defined one user as user_x and choosen letter as 'X' and 2nd user as user_o and his letter as 'O'
which makes my life easier to take decision about the game result. Also I added winner field to store
the key of the winning user.

- I used 3X3 board size but it can be extended that's why I also used a field called board.
-  Score model modified to record result of the game.
It contains 4 fields (user_x, user_o, result and date). Result field can contains
3 types result. I stored string instead of string make it more easy. these values can
be: 'user_x', 'user_o' and 'tie'.

- I gave 2 points to winner and 1 points for tie and 0 points for lose
- I used win_percentage and no_lose_percentage to calculate user rank
- I decided to give players 2 points for win, 1 point for tie and 0 points for lose.
